# M.2BreakoutBoard
A multi-key M.2 (NGFF) breakout board

### Why did you make it?
We made it because we needed it and we couldn't find it out there!
We developed a set of dual-channel LoRa M.2 radios as a part of an Industrial Safety IoT (IIoT) project. After some time, we figured it would be very useful if we could disconnect these M.2 radios from their base boards and connect them to a PC for debugging. Unfortunately the small pitch of M.2 connectors make it pretty hard to solder flying leads and we thought a breakout board would be handy... The rest is history :) 

### What makes it special?
Well... It's not really special, but it's super handy! We can fit any connector to support any key (A B E or M) and it also includes a 4.2 mm standoff. Let us know if you need a taller one!
All the connectors are broken out in pairs but the board does not have controlled impedance.

### Where can I buy it?
